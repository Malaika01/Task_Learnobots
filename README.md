**About the game**
The game test the user's ability to correctly evaluate mathematical relationship between two values. If the given expression is true the user should move green block if it is false 
red block should be moved. Mathematical expression play an important role in programming; particularly in decision making. Additionaly user can make a completed if else block with  help of the objects provided on left hand side.

**Instructions to play**
1. Read the relationship at bottom left corner
2. Decide if it is true or false
3. Make a small program to result in the movement of a cube. Green cube should be moved if the given relationship is true and red should be moved if it is false
4. Based on your move your score is updated
